\title{Generate Mutation Catalog from MAF file}
\usage{
maf2cat(maf)
}
\arguments{
\item{maf}{MAF file name. It must contain a column named \code{Ref_Tri} 
containing the trinucleotide sequences surrounding the mutation site.
If the mutation site reference allele is \code{A, G}, the \code{Ref_Tri}
is the complement sequence of the trinucleotides, such that its central
allele is always \code{C, T}.}
}
\value{
Count matrix with mutation contexts in rows and \code{Tumor_Sample_Barcode}
        in columns.
}
\description{
Input is MAF file and the corresponding trinucleotide catalog matrix is generated
}
