# Introduction

## Mutational signatures
The package `tempoSig` implements mutational signature inference functions and 
utilities primarily based on maximum likelihood algorithms.
Input data are mutational catalogs in the form of matrices, which catalog counts of
mutation types found in multiple samples into pre-defined classes. The most 
often-used example is the catalog of single nucleotide substitutions (SBSs) grouped 
into trinucleotide contexts in which they occur. Mutational signatures are the
patterns of the combination of these genetic features recurrent in tumor samples
[@nikzainal2012; @alexandrov2013; @alexandrov2020]. Up to 30 or ~60 recurrent 
[signatures](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures)
have been established from studies of whole genome and exome sequences of tumor
samples [@alexandrov2020]. The discovery of these signatures is based on mathematical
decompositions of mutational *catalog*, represented by a matrix $\sf{X}$, of a large sample set into two matrices, 
$$
\sf{X} \sim \sf{W}\sf{H},
$$
where $\sf{W}$ and $\sf{H}$ are *signature* and *exposure* matrices, each containing
repertoires of signatures associated with mutational processes operative in samples 
and the actual numbers of mutations contributed by each signature to individual sample genomes, respectively. The symbol $\sim$ indicates that the actual data are to be 
regarded as (Poisson) realizations of the mean given by the product on the right.

Two classes of analysis tasks encountered in genetic studies are *de novo* discovery
of signatures and *refitting*: in *de novo* discovery, both *signature* and *exposure*
matrices are unknown, and large samples of tumor genomes or exomes are used as input
(catalog matrix $\sf{X}$ as a whole) for discovery of signatures. 
The primary algorithm used in *de novo* discovery of signatures is 
non-negative matrix factorization [@alexandrov2013].
In *refitting*, in contrast, existing signature lists are
used (signature matrix $\sf{W}$ given as input) along with input catalogs to 
estimate the exposure matrix $\sf{H}$, whose columns give relative proportions of
signatures present in each sample [@rosenthal2016].

## Maximum likelihood 

The refitting functions in 
`tempoSig` are based on the maximum likelihood inference algorithm adapted from
[mutation-signatures](https://github.com/mskcc/mutation-signatures).
In refitting, each column of catalog $\sf{X}$ and exposure $\sf{H}$ matrices,
corresponding to each sample to be analyzed,
can be treated independent since $\sf{W}$ is assumed known. For a given sample
genome, the mutational catalog data consist of the observed counts $m_i$ 
(a single column of matrix $\sf{X}$), where $i=1,\cdots, c$ is the index 
denoting the mutation type categories under consideration ($c=96$
for SBS data classified into trinucleotide contexts). The inference task then
reduces to the problem of estimating multinomial probabilities $p_i$ of observing
each category $i$ out of 96 based on actual count data $m_i$. The log likelihood,
or the probability of observing data given parameters $\{p_i\}$, is 
$$
L = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^c m_i \ln p_i = \sum_{i<c}{\hat m}_i \ln p_i + 
{\hat m}_c \ln \left(1-\sum_{i<c} p_i\right)
$$
where $M=\sum_i m_i$, $L$ is the log likelihood per mutation, ${\hat m}_i=m_i/M$ 
is the proportion of type $i$ in data, and in the second expression, the 
constraint $\sum_i p_i=1$ was used to eliminate $p_c$, making independent variable
subset $\{p_i,\: (i=1,\cdots,c-1)\}$, explicit.

The multinomial probabilities are given by linear combinations of signature proportions
via
$$
p_i = \sum_{k=1}^K W_{ik} h_k = \frac{\sum_k W_{ik} x_k^2}{\sum_k x_k^2},
$$
where the summation is over all $K$ signatures represented by rows of matrix $\sf{W}$
and $h_k$ is the $k$-th component of the column of $\sf{H}$, giving the proportion
of $k$-th signature. We assume $\sf{W}$ is normalized column-wise, such that
$\sum_i W_{ik}=1$. In the second expression, we parametrized $h_k$ via
$h_k = x_k^2/\sum_{l} x_{l}^2$ such that the non-negativity constraint
for exposure $h_k\ge 0$ is automatically satisfied for any $x_k$. 

The two equations above define the log likelihood as a function of unconstrained
parameters:
$$
L = L(x_1,\cdots,x_{K}),
$$
whose maximization problem can be solved by any multi-dimensional optimization 
algorithm. In `tempoSig`, the analytic form of $L$ is exploited by providing its
first derivatives as input to the quasi-Newton 
BFGS2 (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) routine
[gsl_multimin_fdfminimizer_vector_bfgs2](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/multimin.html) in [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl) (GSL).

## Significance test

For real mutational data with limited sizes (mutational load $M \sim 100$ or less),
it is important to gauge the statistical significance of exposure outcomes
($h_k$ for $k=1,\cdots,K$). In `tempoSig`, $p$-values for each exposure can be estimated
with one of three algorithms:

1. Permutation test of signatures (`permutation`)
2. Likelihood ratio test (`lrt`)
3. Permutation sampling of count data (`x.permutation`)

With signature permutation (default), the 96 elements of the reference signature vector
$W_{ik}$ for signature $k$ is randomly permuted $N_p$ times. Inference is repeated for each
replicate to get exposure samples under the null hypothesis, $\{h_{k}^{(j)}\}$, 
where $j=1,\cdots, N_p$ is the index for permutation replicates.
The $p$-value estimate for the $k$-th signature exposure is
$$
P_{k} = \frac{1}{N_p} \sum_j I\left(h_{k}^{(j)} \ge h_{k}\right),
$$
where $I(x)$ is the indicator function; i.e., the proportion of replicates for which the observed exposure did not exceed the null values.
Note that the resulting p-values are limited in range, with apparent $P_k=0$ indicating that
$P_k < 1/N_p$.

In likelihood ratio test, the deviance
$$
D_k = 2M\left[ L - L(x_k=0)\right],
$$
where $L(x_k=0)$ is the likelihood of the restricted model of signature $k$ exposure zero,
is computed. This deviance is distributed by $\chi^2$ with ${\rm d.f.}=1$ in the 
asymptotic limit $M\rightarrow\infty$ [@degroot_schervish]. Empirical tests suggest 
this asymptotic limit is satisfied if $M\sim 10^3$ or larger and the p-value
computed will generally be an over-estimate. Therefore, we advise 
caution in using the likelihood ratio test for smaller mutation load. However, this test
can give a quick upper bound estimate of p-values, especially for cases where $P < 10^{-4}$
and permutation test only gives ``zero`` p-values.

Finally, in count permutation, the catalog data $m_i$ for $i=1,\cdots,c$ are randomly
permuted while keeping signatures fixed. This scheme is applied once 
to all signatures and requires less computation than signature permutation. We found
it to genereally yield results similar to signature permutation but does not
adequately deal with ``unspecific'' signatures such as Signature 3 (homologous recombination defect). 

## De novo inference

In de novo inference, both the signature $\sf{H}$ and exposure matrices $\sf{W}$ are inferred simultaneously in an unsupervised manner [@alexandrov2013]. `tempoSig` includes functions based on a Bayesian formulation of the
non-negative matrix factorization algorithm [@lee_seung], where the marginal likelihood of models with
varying number of signatures is estimated by a variational algorithm [@bishop; @cemgil]. This feature
enables the most likely number of signatures present in the samples via evaluation of the statistical support 
provided by the data.

# Software usage

## Installation
The main non-R dependency for `tempoSig` is [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl).
It can be installed in Ubuntu Linux by
```{bash eval=FALSE}
$ sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
```
or in CentOS,
```{bash eval=FALSE}
$ yum install gsl-devel
```
To install `tempoSig` along with its dependencies, 
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('mskcc/tempoSig')
```

## Data structure
Load the package via
```{r setup}
library(tempoSig)
```
The main data structure used by `tempoSig` is of S4 class `tempoSig` with slots:
```{r}
slotNames('tempoSig')
```
Except `tmb` and `logLik`, which are vectors, all are matrices. We denote by $n$ the number of
samples (genomes to be analyzed; total number of columns in matrix $\sf{X}$). The slots
are

* `catalog`: catalog data matrix of dimension $c\times n$ with 
  mutation types in rows and samples in columns.
* `signat`: matrix of reference signatures; dimension $c\times K$ with
  mutation types in rows and signatures in columns.
* `tmb`: vector of length $n$; total mutation burden (sum of all mutations) in each
  sample.
* `expos`: matrix of inferred exposure values; dimension $n \times K$ with
  samples in rows and signatures in columns.
* `pvalue`: matrix of estimated $p$-values: dimension $n \times K$ with
  samples in rows and signatures in columns.
* `logLik`: vector of log-likelihood values for each sample.
* `misc`: List of objects associated with de novo infererence.
  
The primary input data takes the form of catalog matrix $\sf{X}$. An example is
provided by the file
```{r catalog}
catalog <- system.file('extdata', 'tcga-brca_catalog.txt', package = 'tempoSig')
x <- read.table(catalog)
dim(x)
x[1:5, 1:2]
rownames(x)
```

This file was generated by taking mutation count data of 10 tumor samples from the
mutation annotation format ([MAF](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/)) file of 
[TCGA BRCA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA) project.
The rownames show 96 trinucleotide mutation types with the `ref > alt` inside
brackets (`ref` either `C` or `T`; otherwise its complementary base taken) and its
two adjacent nucleotides.

An object of class `tempoSig` is created with the catalog data frame as the main 
argument:
```{r temposig}
s <- tempoSig(data = x)
s
```
The object initiation also can include specification of reference signatures via
the optional second argument in `tempoSig(data, signat = NULL)`, which by default
is read from the file
```{r sbs}
sbs <- read.table(system.file('extdata', 'cosmic_snv_signatures_v2.txt',
                              package = 'tempoSig'))
dim(sbs)
sbs[1:5, 1:5]
colnames(sbs)
```
This reference signature list is that of 
[COSMIC version 2](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt).
There are other files for alternative references also included:

* `cosmic_sigProfiler_SBS_signatures.txt`: COSMIC version 3 from whole-genome data (sigProfiler)
* `cosmic_sigProfiler_SBS_exome_signatures.txt`: COSMIC version 3 from exome data
* `cosmic_SigAnalyzer_SBS_signatures.txt`: COSMIC version 3 from whole-genome data (SigAnalyzer)
* `cosmic_sigProfiler_SBS_signatures_v3.1.txt`: COSMIC version 3.1

They can be used as follows:
```{r sig2}
sig2 <- read.table(system.file('extdata', 'cosmic_SigAnalyzer_SBS_signatures.txt',
                               package = 'tempoSig'))
dim(sig2)
sig2[1:5, 1:5]
s2 <- tempoSig(data = x, signat = sig2)
s2
```
The `signat` argument can take the file name directly. For convenience, a character
short-hand can also be used:
```{r sv2, eval = TRUE}
s_v2 <- tempoSig(data = x, signat = 'v2')  # COSMIC v2 (default)
s_v3 <- tempoSig(data = x, signat = 'SA')  # COSMIC v3 SigAnalyzer
s_v4 <- tempoSig(data = x, signat = 'SP')  # COSMIC v3 sigProfiler
s_v3
```
We found that `v2` generally achieves higher power than others under limited mutation loads.

The slots of a `tempoSig` object can be accessed via accessor functions:
```{r}
tmb(s)
catalog(s)[1:2,1:2]
expos(s)
pvalue(s)
```
Note that slots `expos` and `pvalue` are empty since inference has not been performed yet.

## Catalog matrix generation

A common outcome of sequencing experiments takes the form of [MAF](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/) 
files, which
collect variant data of multiple samples with annotations. The package
[maftools](https://bioconductor.org/packages/maftools/) can be used to
derive catalog matrices from MAF files:
```{r laml, eval=FALSE}
if(!require('BiocManager')) install.packages('BiocManager')
if(!require('maftools')) BiocManager::install('maftools')
if(!require('BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19'))
  BiocManager::install('BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19')
laml.maf <- system.file('extdata', 'tcga_laml.maf.gz', package = 'maftools')
laml <- read.maf(maf = laml.maf)
laml.tnm <- maftools::trinucleotideMatrix(maf = laml, prefix = 'chr', add = TRUE,
                                          ref_genome = 'BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19')
catalog <- t(laml.tnm$nmf_matrix)
```

## Refitting

Refitting using maximum likelihood inference is performed by 
```{r refit, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
s <- extractSig(s, progress.bar = FALSE)
```
```{r refit2, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
s <- extractSig(s, progress.bar = TRUE)
```
The option `progress.bar = TRUE` displays a progress bar, useful for 
large samples. The inference fills the `expos` slot of the object:
```{r expos}
expos(s)[1:5,1:2]
rowSums(expos(s))
```
Note that each row gives proportions of reference signatures, which add up to 1.

By default, $p$-value estimation is skipped:
```{r pvalues}
pvalue(s)
```
The flag `compute.pval = TRUE` turns it on:
```{r pvtrue, eval = FALSE, echo= TRUE}
set.seed(135)
s <- extractSig(s, compute.pval = TRUE, pvtest = 'permutation', nperm = 1000, 
                progress.bar = TRUE)
```
```{r pvtrue2, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(135)
s <- extractSig(s, compute.pval = TRUE, pvtest = 'permutation', nperm = 1000, 
                progress.bar = FALSE)
```
```{r pvshow}
pvalue(s)[1:5, 1:5]
```
The above uses the default signature permutation algorithm. 
Note that with the number of permutations `nperm = 1000` (default), the 
lowest non-zero pvalue is $1/1000$. Therefore, the value of 0 indicates
$P < 1/1000$.
The other two options for algorithm are `pvtest = 'lrt'` (likelihood ratio test) and
`pvtest = 'x.permutation'` (count permutation; see above). We try the `lrt` 
for comparison:
```{r nperm, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
sl <- extractSig(s, compute.pval = TRUE, pvtest = 'lrt', progress.bar = TRUE)
```
```{r nperm2, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
sl <- extractSig(s, compute.pval = TRUE, pvtest = 'lrt', progress.bar = FALSE)
```
```{r pvshow2}
pvalue(sl)[1:5,1:5]
```
Note how $P=0$ in `permutation` comes out as nonzero from `lrt` but generally the values 
from the latter are larger in magnitude (over-estimation arising from the use
of asymptotic $\chi^2$ distrubtion).

## Visualization and output

A number of utility functions for plotting and output are included.
The function `plotExposure` shows a bar plot of exposure proportions of a 
specified sample:
```{r expos_plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
sid <- 'TCGA.BH.A0EI.01A.11D.A10Y.09'
plotExposure(s, sample.id = sid, cutoff = 1e-3, cex.axis = 0.7, cex.names = 0.8)
```

The argument `sample.id` can also be an integer index. The `cutoff` argument filters
proportions with the minimum value supplied.
The $p$-values
```{r print}
p <- pvalue(s)[sid,]
p[c('Signature.1','Signature.2','Signature.19','Signature.22')]
```
indicate `Signature.22` is insignificant and 'Signature.2' is borderline. 
We can get a non-zero upper bound for the
`Signature.1` p-value using `lrt`:
```{r p2}
p2 <- pvalue(sl)[sid,]
p2[c('Signature.1','Signature.2','Signature.19','Signature.22')]
```
Again, note the over-estimation under `lrt`.

The function
```{r writee, eval=FALSE}
writeExposure(s, output = 'exposure.tsv', sep = '\t', rm.na = TRUE)
```
will write the exposure, along with $p$-values if any, to a single file. 
Alternatively, one can choose to write two files, one for exposure and the other for
$p$-values via
```{r writee2, eval=FALSE}
writeExposure(s, output = 'exposure.tsv', pv.out = 'pvalues.tsv')
```

## De novo inference

We illustrate de novo inferences using a larger TCGA-BRCA catalog data:
```{r tcga-brca, eval=TRUE}
brca <- read.table(system.file('extdata', 'tcga_brca_mutect_catalog.txt',
                               package = 'tempoSig'))
tcga <- tempoSig(data = brca)
tcga
```

The original NMF algorithm [@lee_seung] applied to signature extraction [@alexandrov2013] is available
in `tempoSig` as a special case of the Bayesian algorithm (fixed prior with hyperparameter not updated):
```{r nmf, eval = TRUE}
set.seed(135)
tcga1 <- extractSig(tcga, method = 'nmf', K = 5, nrun = 10)
tcga1
```
The `nmf` method will invoke the maximum likelihood (non-Bayesian) NMF algorithm, which solves the 
factorization problem for the count matrix iteratively `nrun` times under a given size `K` of signature set
(row and column sizes of matrices $\sf{W}$ $\sf{H}, respectively). Among `nrun` solutions, the best one with
the highest likelihood value is chosen and stored in the object returned. In production runs, an `nrun` value
exceeding $\sim 50$ is recommended.

```{r nmf2, eval = TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
sd0 <- signat(tcga1)
cs0 <- cosineSimilarity(A = sd0, B = sbs)
head(cs0)
heatmap(t(cs0), Rowv = NA, Colv = NA, scale = 'none', revC = TRUE)
```

In the above, we computed the cosine similarity matrix of the 5 de novo signatures with the COSMIC v2 set.
The heatmap indicates that `S1-S5` correspond to Signatures 1 (Aging), 10 (POLE), 6 (MMR), 3 (HRD), and 
2 (APOBEC), respectively.
The following may be used to obtain an assignment based on such overlaps if visual inspection is ambiguous:
```{r lsap, eval = TRUE}
lsap <- clue::solve_LSAP(cs0, maximum = TRUE)
sassign <- colnames(cs0)[lsap]
names(sassign) <- rownames(cs0)
sassign
```

A function `sigplot` will plot signature profiles to aid comparison:
```{r sigplot, eval = TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
old.par <- par(mfrow = c(5, 2), mar = c(3,3,3,1), lwd = 0.2, cex = 1)
for(k in seq(5)){
  sigplot(sd0[, names(sassign)[k]])
  title(main = names(sassign)[k])
  sigplot(sbs[, sassign[k]])
  title(main = sassign[k])
}
par(old.par)
```

## De novo inference with variable number of signatures

In the previous de novo inference example, the number of signatures was set as 5, while this number ($K$) is
unknown in practice. Commonly, the maximum likelihood NMF is augmented by quality measures (reproducibility of
extraction results, etc) to help decide the optimal $K$. A more direct way to determine $K$ is to use
a Bayesian formulation and compute marginal likelihood. The non-Bayesian version invoked by
`extractSig(..., method = nmf)` above is in fact a special case of this Bayesian algorithm.
We scan a range of $K$ values via
```{r bnmf, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.fullwidth = FALSE}
set.seed(152)
tscan <- extractSig(tcga, method = 'bnmf', Kmax = 10, nrun = 10, verbose = 1)
me <- misc(tscan)$measure
me
plot(me, type = 'b', las = 1, bty = 'n')
```

Note that individual runs consist of $K$ values scanned from 2 (default) to `Kmax`. Often, increasing
the size of signature set by one will result in redundant signatures beyond a certain $K$ value. If 
this occurrs, the scan will stop and print this upper bound `Kmax`. In the example above, this upper bound
is often smaller than the maximum 10.
A utility function `kstar` will find the optimal $K$ (cautioned against blind-usages; a visual review is
often necessary):
```{r kstar}
kstar(me)$ropt
```

The object returned by `extractSig(..., method = 'bnmf')` scanning multiple $K$ will in general not
contain the desired signature and exposure matrices in its slots. Therefore, one needs to run another 
inference with a single $K$ determined:
```{r bnmf2}
tcga2 <- extractSig(tcga, method = 'bnmf', Kmin = 7, Kmax = 7)
tcga2
```
It is worth noting that this single-$K$ run output uses a model more general (gamma priors with 
hyper-parameter optmized) than the non-Bayesian version obtained with `method = 'nmf'`.
```{r bnmf3, eval = TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
sd1 <- signat(tcga2)
cs2 <- cosineSimilarity(A = sd1, B = sbs)
heatmap(t(cs2), Rowv = NA, Colv = NA, scale = 'none', revC = TRUE)
lsap2 <- clue::solve_LSAP(cs2, maximum = TRUE)
sassign2 <- colnames(cs2)[lsap2]
names(sassign2) <- rownames(cs2)
sassign2
```
Two additional signatures found here resemble Signature 24 and Signature 11.
