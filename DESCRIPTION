Title: Maximum Likelihood Fitting of Mutational Catalogs and De Novo Inference of Signatures
Version: 0.5.0
Author: Jun Woo
Maintainer: Jun Woo <wooh@mskcc.org>
Depends: R (>= 3.6.0)
Imports: gtools, Rcpp (>= 0.12.16), utils, argparse, coneproj, data.table, RcppEigen
Description: Infers mutation signature exposures from mutation catalog data using
    known signature list (refitting) or via de novo extraction. With de novo extraction,
    the most likely number of signatures is estmated in Bayesian NMF.
    Also includes associated utility functions for significance tests in refitting.
